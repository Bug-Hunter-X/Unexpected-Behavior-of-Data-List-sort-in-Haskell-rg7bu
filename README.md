# Haskell Sorting Bug

This repository demonstrates an example of unexpected behavior or a potential bug related to the `sort` function from `Data.List` in Haskell.  The code includes several test cases that illustrate its functionality. The purpose is to identify potential issues that may arise under specific conditions, such as sorting more complex data types or handling empty lists.  This should help improve understanding and lead to more robust Haskell code.

## Issues and Potential Improvements

The observed behavior in the original code seems correct for simple integer and string lists.  However, edge cases and more complex data types need to be explored to ensure the `sort` function's reliability and performance.  Improvements may include adding more comprehensive tests covering diverse data types and edge cases.
